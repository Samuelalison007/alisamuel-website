## Design Approach 1: Modern Minimalist with Financial Sophistication (Probability: 0.08)

**Design Movement:** Contemporary minimalism with financial aesthetics (inspired by fintech design systems)

**Core Principles:**
- Clean, spacious layouts with intentional negative space
- Data-driven visual hierarchy using typography and subtle color accents
- Precision and clarity in every element—no visual noise
- Professional yet approachable tone through refined typography

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Deep slate blue (#1a3a52) representing trust, stability, and financial expertise
- Accent: Warm gold (#d4a574) for highlights and call-to-action elements, symbolizing value and achievement
- Background: Off-white (#f8f9fa) for clarity and focus
- Rationale: The combination conveys financial sophistication while remaining warm and human

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric grid with left-aligned text and right-aligned visual elements
- Generous vertical spacing (8rem+ between sections)
- Alternating content blocks: text-heavy sections paired with visual breathing room
- Sticky navigation that reveals/hides on scroll for seamless navigation

**Signature Elements:**
1. Subtle animated line dividers between sections (horizontal lines that animate on scroll)
2. Circular accent badges for key metrics (e.g., "MBA Merit," "GSU Award")
3. Minimalist timeline for experience/education with hover interactions

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations (elements fade in as they enter viewport)
- Hover states that subtly elevate cards and reveal additional information
- Micro-interactions on buttons: slight scale and color shift on hover
- Scroll-linked animations that feel purposeful, not gratuitous

**Animation:**
- Entrance animations: Fade + subtle slide-up (200ms) as sections come into view
- Hover effects: Cards lift with soft shadow on hover (150ms ease-out)
- Button interactions: Color shift + slight scale (1.02x) on hover
- Timeline: Animated connectors that draw on scroll

**Typography System:**
- Display: Poppins Bold (700) for main headings—modern and confident
- Body: Inter Regular (400) for paragraphs—highly readable and professional
- Accent: Poppins SemiBold (600) for subheadings and highlights
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem (h1) → 2rem (h2) → 1.25rem (h3) → 1rem (body)
